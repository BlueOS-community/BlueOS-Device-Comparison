# BlueOS-Device-Comparison
A community-sourced reference to compare computers, sensors, and actuators that are relevant to BlueOS.

The intent is for this to track device specifications (and price estimates) for straightforward comparison, including devices that do not yet have BlueOS integrations.

> ***NOTE:* Community sourced data may be incomplete and/or incorrect.**

## Interpretation
- **Bold** is used to indicate a "best" component of a table column
- `?` is used for data that is currently unknown

## Contributing
Feel free to add additional devices and updated information to the existing files, or create a new file to compare a new device type. Device manufacturers are encouraged to include their devices here, and/or fix/add any incorrect or missing information from an existing listing.

New tracked device types should include a brief description of what the device type is used for in this readme (including what types of vehicles it can be used on, e.g. underwater, aerial, etc), and a more detailed description in the file that includes how the device type is relevant to BlueOS.

## Current Tracked Device Types

| Device Type | Purpose | Medium(s) |
